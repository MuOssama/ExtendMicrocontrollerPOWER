# ExtendMicrocontrollerPOWER

**Extend Microcontroller POWER** aims to enhance microcontroller capabilities. This repository provides methods for:

- **Increasing PWM Channels**: Use demultiplexers to expand analog outputs.
- **Increasing ADC Channels**: Utilize multiplexers to boost analog inputs.
- **Increasing Digital Outputs**: Implement shift registers to add more digital outputs.

## Repository Contents

This repo includes three essential elements for each of the three projects:

1. **Code**: Source code for implementing the methods.
2. **HEX Files**: Compiled files for use with Proteus and firmware burning.
3. **Proteus Projects**: Complete project files for simulation in Proteus.

Feel free to explore and contribute!
