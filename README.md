Extend Microcontroller POWER.\
in this repo, a method for increasing microcontroller timer PWM channels (increasing Analog Outputs using Demultiplexes) , ADC channels (increasing Analog Inputs using Multiplexes), and Shift registers (increase digital Outputs).  there are three elements code to each of the three projects, hex files for Proteus, firmware burning, and Proteus projects.
